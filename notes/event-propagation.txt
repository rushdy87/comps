DOM Events describes 3 phases of event propagation:
  1. Capturing phase – the event goes down to the element.
  2. Target phase – the event reached the target element.
  3. Bubbling phase – the event bubbles up from the element.

- Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, 
  when an event occurs in an element inside another element, and both elements have 
  registered a handle for that event. The event propagation mode determines in which 
  order the elements receive the event.
- With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and 
  then propagated to outer elements.
  With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated 
  to the inner elements.
