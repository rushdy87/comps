HTML table basics
- see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics
- The content of every table is enclosed by these two tags : <table></table>.
- The smallest container inside a table is a table cell, which is created by a <td> 
  element ('td' stands for 'table data').
- the <tr> element ('tr' stands for 'table row'). Let's investigate this now.
- To recognize the table headers as headers, both visually and semantically, you can 
  use the <th> element ('th' stands for 'table header').
- The <tfoot> element needs to wrap the part of the table that is the footer â€” this might 
  be a final row with items in the previous rows summed.
- The <tbody> element needs to wrap the other parts of the table content that aren't in 
  the table header or footer.
