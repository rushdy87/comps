Refs in React
  - Refs are a function provided by React to access the DOM element and the React element that you 
    might have created on your own. They are used in cases where we want to change the value of a 
    child component, without making use of props and all. They also provide us with good functionality 
    as we can use callbacks with them. 

React JS useRef Hook
  - The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the DOM element in the functional 
    component.
  - Syntax:
      const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
  - The useRef returns a mutable ref object. This object has a property called .current. The value is 
    persisted in the refContainer.current property. These values are accessed from the current property 
    of the returned object. The .current property could be initialised to the passed argument initialValue 
    e.g. useRef(initialValue). The object can persist a value for a full lifetime of the component. 
  - useRef Implementation:
      1. create a ref at the top of your component by calling 'useRef'.
      2. Assign the ref to jsx element as a prop called 'ref'.
      3. access the DOM with ref.current
