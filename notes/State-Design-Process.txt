State Design Process Overview
- see 30.drawio in diagrams
What state + event handlers are there?
  1. List out what a user will do and changes they will see while using your app.
  2. Categorize each step as 'state' or 'event handler'.
  3. Group common steps. Remove duplicates. Rewrite descriptions.
What name and type?
  4. Look at mockup. Remove or simplify parts that aren't changing.
  5. Replace remaining elements with text descriptions.
  6. Repeat #4 and #5 with a different variation.
  7. Imagine you have to write a function that returns the text of steps #5 and #6.
      In addition to your component props, what other arguments would you need?
Where's it defined?
  8. Decide where each event handler + state will be defined.
